This project T-Link is for Google Girl Hackathon 2017, conducted by Dongyu Jiang(Peking Univ), Lin Luo(Peking Univ), Xi Luo(Peking Univ), Haoyue Shi(Peking Univ) and Yufei Ye(Tsinghua Univ). 

T-Link explores the Hacker News data. It focuses on mining connections among components, such as hot topics and senior users. Those connections are demonstrated by maps, whose size indicates the popularity of the component and edges indicates the similarity. The data behind is mined by NLP and ML techniques, such as natural entity recognition and word embedding.

We developed the product in two days and won the User Experience Award.
